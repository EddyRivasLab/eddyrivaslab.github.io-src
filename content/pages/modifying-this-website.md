This website is built using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and  [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a tool that converts documents written in Markdown into HTML websites.  All of the complexity of running Pelican and getting the resulting web pages into the right place for Github to serve them as a website has been automated, so after some first-time setup, making changes only requires a Git checkout-commit-push cycle.

##First time Setup
The simplest way to contribute to this site is to do your work on the RC cluster, where all of the required Pelican and Python packages have already been installed.<span class="marginnote">
